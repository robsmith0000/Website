<!-- Hey there!
My name is Rob and I love exploring new ideas. I have just graduated Durham uni with a Msci in Maths and Physics. I have varied interests in maths, physics, philosophy, rowing, self-improvement and entrepreneurship. This website is a catalogue of my work and a way to crystallise my thoughts on topics. 

Who Am I? -->

Hi there! I'm Rob, a young professional passionate about technology in the realms of Web3 and AI. I am an advocate for free and open-source software and have a long standing love for Linux and the possibilities collaborative projects can create.  I have a background in Mathematical Physics, having completed my Master's at Durham University. Outside of work and research, I’ve spent years fostering community building within the tech space. I’ve had the privilege of being part of the first Network School Cohort, which shaped my collaborative and entrepreneurial mindset.

# Interests

* **Emerging Technologies:** My work often revolves around the latest developments in Web3, blockchain, cryptography, artificial intelligence, and decentralized technologies. I find these fields not only fascinating but transformative. I see them as fundamental pillars of a new era of connectivity and digital sovereignty.



* **Quantified Self & Longevity:** My time at Network School introduced me into the world of longevity science and I am interested in how we can use new technology to become healthier and live longer.



* **Fitness & Rowing:** A long-time rower, fitness plays a central role in my life. I find fitness as a mirror into high performance in my professional work.

* **Cultural Exploration & Languages:** Although learning languages isn’t my strongest suit, I’m fascinated by the diversity of cultures around the world. I love exploring new places and experiencing different ways of life, which continually shape my worldview.
