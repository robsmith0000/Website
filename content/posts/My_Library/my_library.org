** Never Eat Alone (Keith Ferrazzi)

- Just give and try to help others, give out value without expecting immdiate returns, do this like twitter and in real life, help people with the opportunities
- Personal brand, by putting ones self out into the world
- When going to networking events what is my objective, research before hand, ask open ended questions, share value with them
- Follow up with people that you think are doing good things, makes a good impression
- Introducing contacts together is so important in order to build good relationships, what bill from sosv was talking about. Hosting web 3 events or doing dinner parties eating together is so important
- How can we translate this into the online world

This is how to build a professional network of people

*** Key Concepts from "Never Eat Alone" by Keith Ferrazzi
1. **Build Genuine Relationships**: Networking is about creating genuine connections rather than collecting business cards. Focus on establishing real, authentic relationships.

2. **Generosity**: Approach networking with a mindset of generosity. Help others without expecting immediate returns. Provide value, whether through advice, introductions, or support.

3. **Follow-Up**: Maintain and nurture relationships by regularly following up with contacts. This can be through simple check-ins, sharing relevant information, or offering assistance.

4. **Be Proactive**: Don’t wait for networking opportunities to come to you. Take initiative in reaching out to people and creating opportunities to connect.

5. **Leverage Existing Networks**: Use your current network to expand your connections. Ask friends, colleagues, and acquaintances to introduce you to others.

6. **The Power of Social Events**: Attend social events, conferences, and gatherings where you can meet new people. Make a habit of never eating alone by scheduling meals with others.

7. **Build a Personal Brand**: Develop a strong personal brand that reflects your values, expertise, and personality. This helps others understand who you are and what you stand for.

8. **Reciprocity**: Create a cycle of giving and receiving. When you help others, they are more likely to help you in return. This builds a network based on mutual support.

9. **Be Persistent and Patient**: Building a strong network takes time and consistent effort. Be patient and persistent in your efforts to connect and build relationships.

10. **Use Technology**: Utilize technology and social media to stay connected with your network. Platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook can help you maintain and grow your professional relationships.

11. **Practice Active Listening**: Show genuine interest in others by listening actively. Understand their needs, goals, and challenges, and see how you can assist them.

12. **Personalize Your Approach**: Tailor your communication and approach to each individual. Personalization shows that you value the person and are genuinely interested in them.

13. **Set Goals**: Set clear, actionable networking goals. Know what you want to achieve through your networking efforts and create a plan to reach those goals.

14. **Be Authentic**: Authenticity is crucial in building trust and meaningful relationships. Be yourself and stay true to your values and principles.

15. **Continuous Learning**: Keep learning and improving your networking skills. Read books, attend workshops, and seek feedback to become a better networker.

By applying these concepts, "Never Eat Alone" aims to help readers build a powerful and supportive network that can lead to personal and professional success.


Keith Ferrazzi emphasizes the use of a personal CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system to effectively manage and nurture his relationships. Here's how he utilizes a personal CRM:

1. **Organizing Contacts**: Keith uses a personal CRM to keep track of his extensive network. This system helps him categorize and organize contacts based on various criteria such as industry, relationship type, and level of importance.

2. **Tracking Interactions**: The CRM allows him to log and track all interactions with his contacts. This includes meetings, phone calls, emails, and social media interactions. By keeping a detailed history, he can maintain continuity in his relationships and remember key details about each contact.

3. **Setting Reminders**: To ensure he follows up regularly, Keith sets reminders and alerts within his CRM. These prompts help him stay in touch with his network consistently, whether it’s for birthdays, anniversaries, or just a regular check-in.

4. **Personalizing Communication**: With detailed information about his contacts stored in the CRM, Keith can personalize his communication. This helps him tailor his messages to suit the individual needs and interests of each contact, making his interactions more meaningful and effective.

5. **Identifying Opportunities**: The CRM helps Keith identify opportunities for networking and collaboration. By analyzing his network and interactions, he can spot potential synergies, partnerships, and opportunities for mutual benefit.

6. **Prioritizing Relationships**: Not all relationships are equal, and a CRM helps Keith prioritize his efforts. He can focus more on high-value relationships that are crucial for his personal and professional growth, while still maintaining broader connections.

7. **Maintaining Consistency**: Consistency is key in relationship building. The CRM ensures that Keith maintains a regular touchpoint with his network, which is critical for sustaining long-term relationships.

8. **Data-Driven Insights**: By analyzing the data within his CRM, Keith can gain insights into his networking habits and strategies. This helps him refine his approach and improve the effectiveness of his networking efforts.

In summary, Keith Ferrazzi's use of a personal CRM system allows him to manage his extensive network systematically, ensuring that he maintains strong, meaningful, and mutually beneficial relationships.









** Never Split the Difference (Chris Voss)
~Should re read this before doing a negotiation~

- Try and see it from the others point of view undercover the motivations
- Get use to silence when you speak it is a powerful tool, try to cut out the umms and ars
- Mirroring is copying the other persons behavior speech and gestures
- Repeating or echoing the last few words
- Paraphrase the argument to see if you understand and show that you are linstening
- When you speek creating slence give people time to come in and reconsider even if the silence feels uncomfortable resist the urge to fill it with chatter it will be more powerful that way
- Get the other person talking and dont think about just doing it all yourself
- Negotiation should be done with an anchor which gives you the reference point to make the suggestiosn and then the negotiations go around that point.
- Definately re read this before negotiating a contract with employers
- Ackerman model to get into the haggle better, this is the way to negotiate price a better way,
- Mirroring is a great way to keep people talking

Investing in myself though courses and education about how to speak etc
randomness is a fact of life so we should embrace this, we should gain from randomness not just die, stay around long enough to capitalize on this
Barbell strategy, minimal risk on one side to stay alive and exposure to crazy gains
