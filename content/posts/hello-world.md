Here is a couple of lists to test formatting 
1. This is the first item
2. This is the second item 
3. tis is 3rd item
    1. how does this deal with indentation
    2. who knows


+ Here is some unordered lists
+ I would say org mode is so much easier to work with when using markdown
    + here is an indentation
    + I wonder how this is going to work 

    *** 
    to create a backslash
    I should try and create images and other links 
    <html>
      <head>
      </head>
    </html>
To Indent code I should use 4 spaces Although Im not sure how much code edits I will be doign in my blog
