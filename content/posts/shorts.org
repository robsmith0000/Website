The Best Trick to Boost Productivity

Intermittently intermittent fast

Here are my lessons I have learned about how fasting helps my productivity and focus ...

-----

1/ Focus Boost:

Fasting sharpens my focus and motivation.

The discomfort of hunger drives me to get things done.

I feel productive but I am more irritable when interacting with people

-----

2/ Convenience:

Skipping meals simplifies life.

Traveling? Busy day? No problem.

Not needing to worry about 3 meals a day is convenient and freeing

-----

3/ Snacking Solution:

One meal a day (OMAD) = no snacking temptation.

When you limit yourself to a single meal, decision-making becomes easier, and you naturally reduce sugar intake

-----

4/ When to Eat?

Following @bryan_johnson
  I experimented with meal timing:

-> Eating in the evening works best for me

-> Eating in the morning is better for sleep quality but didn't work for me (I didn't like falling asleep hungry)

-----

5/ Challenges with OMAD:

Getting enough calories in one meal is tough, especially with healthy foods

Lifting weights on an empty stomach is not fun especially squats

-----

6/ Coffee Helps:

Having coffee while fasting makes it more manageable.

It suppresses hunger and keeps energy up. (But donâ€™t overdo it and destroy your sleep!)

-----

7/ Why I Fast:

Intermittent fasting and OMAD are my go-to methods for better focus, weight control, and reducing snacking.

There are also various health benefits tied to fasting. Itâ€™s not perfect, but it works for me

My problem with being a Digital Nomad: How to meet people?

The freedom to work anywhere is amazing but Instagram never shows you the epidemic of loneliness among solo travelers.

Here are some ways I have found to find interesting people and the future of living...


-----

1/ People >> Places

You could be living in the most beautiful place in the world but if you are all alone then most people will struggle!

The experience is much more determined by the type of people you meet rather than the land you stay on.

So how do you find people?

-----

2/ Accommodation

Airbnb is great but can be lonely
Hostels are social but you either meet vagrants or vagabonds (more of the former)

The best for me was finding a hotel with a great social lobby that allows for working.

-----

3/ Meetups

Here are some sites that I used to find things going on in the local area: 

. Airbnb Experiences

. Meetup.com

. Facebook Events

. Eventbrite

. Couch Surfing

. Lu.ma

. Running clubs

. Churches

. Social Dances

Between these you will find events to meet like minded people

-----

4/ Co-living and pop-up cities

To find the best quality people and experiences see if you can find co-living in the city!

After staying at Network School I am very bullish on pop-up cities its co-living ++ 

100+ people, aligned and working, you will meet some amazing people

-----

5/ It sounds crazy but I truly believe that pop-up cities will become a very large market within the remote working lifestyle!

Maybe these pop-up cities will eventually become new countries!
